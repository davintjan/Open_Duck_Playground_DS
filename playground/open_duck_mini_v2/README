We run mujoco_infer.py to launch the simulation
We call the key_callback to publish command

To make it run to a certain position, we can bypass the key_callback and use a dynamical system

1. Make it callback the position of the center and continuously print it [DONE]
2. Create a DS in 2D space because we only care about the position of the goal 
3. Based on the max value of lin vel in xy and q, we clip that DS output
